## ICOS Carbon Portal API

access data and meta data.

https://studio.apicur.io . From apicurio you may directly publish the specificatoin
to your git hub repo.


Many tools to parse, create documentatoin, convert between formats or 
generate server and client stubs can be found at https://openapi.tools/


Documentation, python and scala code, for the ICOS Carbon Portal API was generated out of the box by
