## ICOS Carbon Portal API 

Specification for a human friendly API at the ICOS Carbon Portal to 
access data and meta data.

The OPEN API V3 is based on https://www.openapis.org/ and was created with 
https://studio.apicur.io . From apicurio you may directly publish the specification
to your git hub repo.

Many tools to parse, create documentation, convert between formats or 
generate server and client stubs can be found at https://openapi.tools/


The current version 0.0.1 of the specification is regarded as a demo to the ICOS Carbon Portal.
Please leave an "issue" if you find something not working, or you would like to add functionality, etc.
